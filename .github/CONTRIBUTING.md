## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Coding Guidelines and Development

-   Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/)
-   Whenever possible please fix pre-existing code standards errors in the files that you change. It is ok to skip that for larger files or complex fixes.
-   Ensure that your code supports the minimum supported versions of PHP and WordPress; this is shown at the top of the `readme.txt` file.
-   Make sure to write good and detailed commit messages (see [this post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for more on this) and follow all the applicable sections of the pull request template.
-   Please avoid modifying the changelog directly or updating the .pot files.
